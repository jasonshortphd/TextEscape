# TextEscape
Unity text based game written in C# script for the logic

I am taking a Udemy course written by https://www.completeunitydeveloper.com/ for Unity development.  
One of the early demo apps they have you build is a text based game in Unity!  I thought
it was quite funny to build such an old school game in such a high tech environment.  You could do this
with html and javascript was easier, but it is a great way to learn C# and it was fun.  So I decided to 
make a little larger game than theirs and put it on GitHub to share with the class.
